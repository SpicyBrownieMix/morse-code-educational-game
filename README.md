# Educational Morse Code App

This repository contains the source code for an Educational Morse Code App, developed from scratch as Assignment 9 for the CS3505: Software Practice II Spring 2024 course at the University of Utah under the direction of professor Eric Heisler. The application is designed to teach users to read and listen to Morse code, focusing on the letters of the alphabet and the period, but not numbers.

## Overview

The application follows the model-view design principle:
- **MainWindow**: Acts as the view and owns the model.
- **Model**: Encapsulates the application's data and logic.

### Key Features

- **Progressive Learning**: The game is structured into 6 levels. Each level introduces 4-6 new letters, starting with AIERNT.
- **Guided Learning**: The "Captain" character provides instructions and guidance, helping users learn and practice Morse code.
- **Assessments**: Assessments are provided at the end of each level to determine what the user needs more practice with.
- **Interactive Learning**: Users engage in listening to the captain, practicing individual letters, forming words with learned letters, and taking assessments to progress through levels.
- **Continuous Practice**: After completing all levels, users can continue to practice as much as they want.
